I am currently a principal data scientist in Fidelity Invetment. Previously, I was a speech research scientist in 3M/M*Modal. I also spent  more than two and half years as a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University working with Prof. Vahid Tarokh. I received my Ph.D. from Iowa State University under the supervision of Dr. Chinamy Hegde.
