## What Is Statistics?
* Informally speaking, statistics aims to infer the underlying distribution of data given some set of samples/observations/measurements drawn from this unknown distribution. For example, suppose the target distribution is parametrized by parameter \\(\pmb{\theta}\\). In that case, the goal is to find the best \\(\pmb{\theta}\\) in some sense to agree with the set of the collected observations/samples.
* In general, there are two approaches for statistical problems: parametric methods and non-parametric methods. 
* Here we focus on parametric methods and assume that our unknown underlying distribution is parametrized by parameter \\(\pmb{\theta}\\). The process of estimating \\(\pmb{\theta}\\)â€€from the set of data is called model fitting, or training, and is at the heart of machine learning.
