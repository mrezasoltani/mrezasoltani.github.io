title: "Welcome to the ML/DL course."
classes: wide
---

* Websiste of the course: [https://mrezasoltani.github.io/course_modules/](https://mrezasoltani.github.io/course_modules/)
* Some logistics:
  * This course needs some extra effort as 4-6 hours/week as a minimum spending time.
  * There are weekly assignments. both theoretical and programming questions.
  * Assignments should be done individually' however, discussion with your friends is encouraged.
  * Many of questions in the assignments may seem challenging at the first attempt, but with enough spending time, every student can solve them. 
  * In addition to the course materials, you may engage yourself with numerous resources out there.
  * Being active in the class is **VERY** important for me. This is not a spectator sport. The more you engage yourself in the course, the better understanding of concepts.
  * Always try to ask any questions you may have. There is no place to be shy.
  * Most questions and examples come with real-world datasets.

* We start by introducing what machine learning is, and why we need to know about it. Next, we review the required mathematical background for understanding Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).
* We cover the following fundamental topics:
 1. Linear Algebra
 2. Probability
 3. Statistics
 4. Optimization

* Next we do a crash course in Python and Numpy.
* The tentative content is listed as follows (please note this list is subject to change).
