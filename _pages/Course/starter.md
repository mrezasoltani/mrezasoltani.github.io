title: "Welcome to the ML/DL course."
classes: wide
---

* Websiste of the course: [https://mrezasoltani.github.io/course_modules/](https://mrezasoltani.github.io/course_modules/)
* Some logistics:
  * This course needs some extra effort as 4-6 hours/week as a minimum spending time.
  * There are weekly assignments. both theoretical and programming questions.
  * Assignments should be done individually' however, discussion with your friends is encouraged.
  * Many of questions in the assignments may seem challenging at the first attempt, but with enough spending time, every student can solve them. 
  * In addition to the course materials, you may engage yourself with numerous resources out there.
  * Being active in the class is **VERY** important for me. This is not a spectator sport. The more you engage yourself in the course, the better understanding of concepts.
  * Always try to ask any questions you may have. There is no place to be shy.
  * Most questions and examples come with real-world datasets.
  * To be successful in this course, you need to develop both your mathematical background and the programming skills.

* Course Material
 * There is no formal reference for this course. All material will be posted online the (course webpage)[https://mrezasoltani.github.io/course_modules/]. Please make sure to check the course webpage regularly as course materials will be added weekly as ww progress towards the end of the class.
 * Here is a breif list of some useful spurces to educate yourself. The full list of all sources and useful book, papers, blogs, etc cab found in [here]().

* We start by introducing what machine learning is, and why we need to know about it. Next, we review the required mathematical background for understanding Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).
* We cover the following fundamental topics:
 1. Linear Algebra
 2. Probability
 3. Statistics
 4. Optimization

* Next we do a crash course in Python and Numpy.
* The tentative content is listed as follows (please note this list is subject to change).
