# Module 1 - Introduction:

* We start with some introduction about what machine learning is, and why we need to know about it. Next we review the required mathematical background for leaning Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Leanring (DL).
* We cover the following fundumental topics:
1. Linear Algebra
2. Probablity
3. Statistics
4. Optimization
   
* Next we do a crash course in python and numpy.
## What is machine learning ?
* With the deluge of data, we need to find ways to discover about what is in data. ML is a set algorithms/methods which help us to learn and recognize the hidden patterns in data. ML is not a new topic. In fact, learning from data has been explored and used by many dicipline such as Statistics, Signal Processing, Control Theory, etc. What makews ML special is to provide a common fomalizm to the problems and algorithms. With the help of ML techniques, one can predict future data, or to perform other kinds of decision making under uncertainty.
* There are different types of ML. Two common types of categorizing ML methods:
1. Supervised and unsupervised
2. Discriminative and Generative
### Supervised and unsupervised
* In supervised methods, we are given a set of $N$ input-output pairs $\mathcal{D}=$ $`\{(x_i, y_i)\}`$$_{i=1}^N$, and the goal is to learn a map from inputs, $x_i$'s to outputs, $y_i$'s. Input variables are knowm with different names like **features**, **attributes**, or **covariates**. These input variables are typically a $p$-dimentional vetors, denoting for example hights and weights of different persons (in this case, $p=2$. That is, $x_i$ is a 2-dimentional real vector corresponidng to the $i^{th}$ person.
