* **Most datasets used in ML literature:**
  1. **UCI Machine Learning Repository.** The Machine Learning Repository at UCI provides an up-to-date resource for open-source datasets ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)).
  2. **Google Dataset Search.** Similar to how Google Scholar works, Dataset Search lets you find datasets wherever they are hosted, whether it’s a publisher’s site, a digital library, or an author’s web page. It contains over 25 million datasets ([link](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)).
  3. **Kaggle.** Kaggle provides a large container of datasets, including over 50,000 public datasets and 400,000 public notebooks for the purpose of data exploratory  analysis (EDA) ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/)).
  4. **VisualData.** It includes computer vision datasets by category; it allows searchable queries ([link](https://visualdata.io/discovery)).
  5. **CMU Libraries.** This database includes high-quality datasets thanks to the collection of Huajin Wang, at CMU ([link](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/machine-learning/datasets)).
  6. **The Big Bad NLP Database.** This cool dataset contains datasets for various natural language processing tasks, created and curated by Quantum Stat ([link](https://index.quantumstat.com/)).
  7. **Hugging Face.** This popular hub and framework contains 46,121 datasets used in state-of-the-art ML/DL research. This database includes all modalities of data like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), Speech, Tabular, and Multimodal ([link](https://huggingface.co/datasets)).
  8. **Data.world.** This is yet another data source. Data.world calls itself a "collaborative data community" and holds over 100,000 datasets ranging from crime to social media ([link](http://data.world/search?q=type%3Adataset&type=resources)).
  9. **Data.gov.** This is a database for the US Government's open data as an attempt to be more transparent. This database hosts over 300,000 datasets from different fields such as environment, ocean, and agriculture ([link](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset)).
  10. **Earthdata.** Earthdata has been created by NASA as a part of its Earth Science Data Systems Program called Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) ([link](http://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search)).
